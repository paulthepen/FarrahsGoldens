                            It all started with a bright-eyed veterinary technician.
                            Amy's big heart was distraught as she worked with many families who had to have their family friends put down
                            due to cancer. This was an especially heart-wrenching trend with Golden Retrievers. As Amy moved on and raised
                            a family, she never forgot about the troublesome breed, and when the opportunity presented itself, She decided to do something about it.

                            Amy had decided that she was going to work towards the goal of eliminating cancer
                            in the Golden Retriever breed. She did extensive research into reputable breeders across
                            the country until she found Farrah who was just around the corner. The rest is history.

                            The goal of Farrah's Goldens is to responsibly raise companion Golden Retrievers that
                            have a significantly smaller change of developing cancer later in life. Stud males are
                            chosen primarily for this purpose which will hopefully lead to a lower chance of cancer in future generations.

                    <p>Princess Farrah Muffin was born March 13th, 2018 at Lonesome Pine's Goldens.
                        She was taken to her forever home by Amy Charpie when she was 8 weeks of age and she has spent her time as a wonderful family companion.
                        Amy always had thoughts of breeding her in hopes of bettering the Golden Retriever breed, but many tests needed to be performed to
                        determine the perfect match to complement Farrah's genetics.

                    <p>
                        Farrah's first pregnancy and litter went well, and she is currently nursing and recovering from a healthy litter of puppies.
